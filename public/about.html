<h1>About Fabrizio</h1>
<p>My name is Fabrizio Gotchalk and I'm a third year student of Software Engineering trying to acquire web development skills. I was born and am currently living in Paraguay, a tropical country right in the middle of South America. </p>
<p>My hobbies as of recently are programming projects, gaming and going to the gym. I also enjoy the company of my friends as well as my family so I spend a lot of my time with them as well. The main sport I play is basketball although I have recently become very interested in bowling after trying it out a couple of times.</p>
<p>My dream for the future is getting a job that rewards creativity with a positive work-environment filled with peers dedicated to their work as well as encouraging each other. I would also like to travel the world, specifically Japan is the country I'm most interested in visiting.</p>
